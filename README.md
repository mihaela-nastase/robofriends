## Instructions

This is a responsive React app that displays a list of cards containing a picture and contact information. It has a fixed header with a logo and a search bar. 

This app was built following the tutorial by Andrei Neagoie from his Junior to Senior Web Developer course on Udemy. His app can be found [here](https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends).

I diverted from the tutorial by changing the CSS to remove one of two scrollbars, so the app would display correctly. Then I decided to do away with the Scroll component (containing the CardList) and created a fixed header using CSS only, so the scroll bar would cover the entire window (including the header).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To view this project, run 'npm install', then 'npm start' in the project directory. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
